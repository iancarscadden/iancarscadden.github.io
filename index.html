            <h2>About SMPL</h2>
            <p>SMPL is a new programming language that focuses on readability, maintainability, and extensibility. Designed with a clean syntax and robust parsing under the hood, SMPL makes it easier to write, debug, and scale your code.</p>
            <p>Whether you're building small scripts or large systems, SMPL's recursive descent parser and AST-based architecture ensure that adding new features or understanding existing code is straightforward.</p>

            <h2>Key Features</h2>
            <ul class="feature-list">
                <li><strong>AST-Based Parsing:</strong> Enjoy maintainable and easily extensible code, thanks to an internal architecture that uses an Abstract Syntax Tree for all expressions.</li>
                <li><strong>Clear Syntax:</strong> SMPL's syntax is designed to be intuitive and minimal, reducing cognitive load and making your code easier to review and understand.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible Type System:</strong> Work seamlessly with numbers, strings, lists, and user-defined classes, all integrated into a cohesive environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Robust Error Handling:</strong> Detailed error messages help you quickly identify and fix issues in your code.</li>
                <li><strong>Built-In &amp; User-Defined Functions:</strong> SMPL comes with common utilities (like `get_input`, math functions) and user-defined functions are easy to integrate and maintain.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>To begin using SMPL, clone the official repository and run the interpreter on your first SMPL file. For example:</p>
            <pre><code>
git clone https://github.com/username/smpl.git
cd smpl
python3 interpreter.py examples/hello_world.smpl
            </code></pre>
            <p>Check out the docs for advanced usage, including creating classes, working with lists, and extending the language with new functions.</p>
